# Google Slides Manager
**`ðŸ”´ NO LONGER IN USE`**

Google Slides Manager was an app script project I made during 2019-2020 COVID pandemic for my father ( teacher ) and my school. This project , a lot bigger than **form_attendance** , revolves around a similar idea. To copy a slide from a sample and place it in an appropriate folder with the appropriate name. It is very flexible , and has its own settings dashboard too along with the feature to reset it if something goes wrong.

## STACK USED :
- Google Script
- App Script API
